MangaRock app allows users to download chapers.

However they name their chaper folders with cryptic URL numbers, and don't add file extions to the images.
This program looks at the file type of each image, and adds their file extension (png, jpeg, gif, ect).
It also names the folders from 1, making it more readable.

Should work fine on Linux or Windows.

Usage:

1)  Move your downloaded folders into the folder 'files'
2)  in the console enter "sh run.sh" or "python main.py"

Files:

main.py - renames the files
clear.sh - deletes the contents of 'files'
run.sh - runs main.py
