MangaRock app allows users to download chapers.

However they name their chaper folders with cryptic URL numbers, and don't add file extions to the images.
This program looks at the file type of each image, and adds their file extension (png, jpeg, gif, ect).
It also names the folders from 1, making it more readable.
